<h2 id="Code">Code<a class="anchor-link" href="#Code"> </a></h2><p>You're looking at the code -- the notebooks <em>are</em> the code, with the exception of the <a href="script_doc.html">Ellipse Editor and Console Scripts</a>. Currently this is an anonymous mirror of a non-anonymous repository of a very similar name.</p>

<h2 id="Datasets">Datasets<a class="anchor-link" href="#Datasets"> </a></h2><p>We weren't sure how to anonymously release a dataset on Zenodo. So for now, during the review process, we have datasets stored on Dropbox that are accessible via the <a href="core.html#get_data">get_data()</a> function. Arguments to <a href="/espiownage/core.html#get_data"><code>get_data</code></a> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>'cleaner'  = Our Real dataset (clean-er than precleaned)</li>
<li>'preclean' = The aggregated output of 15 or more volunteers (per annotation) on Zooniverse</li>
<li>'spnet'  = The formerly-private Real dataset from Hawley &amp; Morrison's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00632">"ConvNets for Counting..."</a>/"SPNet" paper. Released with the original authors' permission. </li>
<li>'cyclegan' = The 1200-image "CGSmall" subset of the public <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4445434">"SPNet Dataset Release"</a> used for the SPNet paper. Note that the ring counts in this dataset are only integers.</li>
<li>'fake2' = We created a new 'fake' dataset like the one used on SPNet but without the former's limitation of integer-quantized ring counts.   ...We didn't get a chance to CycleGAN it in time, but we plan to do so soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pending favorable review, these datasets will be released on Zenodo with relevant authors' names. 
{% include note.html content='The above datasets are each approximately 2000 images and their corresponding labels, crops, etc.   One dataset we will <em>not</em> be releasing is the full 14,000-frame unlabeled set of videos of the drum, from which a few of the paper graphs, i.e. those in Figure 4, are derived.  These 14000 frames are being kept back as "proprietary" so that the authors can learn &amp; publish about additional physics now that we have the tools to study this sytem.' %}</p>

<h2 id="Pretrained-Model-Weights">Pretrained Model Weights<a class="anchor-link" href="#Pretrained-Model-Weights"> </a></h2><p>These too are stored on Dropbox for now, and the function <a href="https://maskedstudent.github.io/espiownage/core.html#get_checkpoint">get_checkpoint()</a> is intended to load them as with get_data.  We release weights for the real dataset tasks of</p>
<ul>
<li>bounding box detection</li>
<li>counting rings in cropped images</li>
<li>segmentation-regression</li>
<li>segmentation (all one class)</li>

<h2 id="Full-Release-Directory">Full Release Directory<a class="anchor-link" href="#Full-Release-Directory"> </a></h2><p>The data and the weights both exist in Dropbox as sub-directories of a publicly-accessible <code>espiownage-release</code> directory, accessible via <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/24eqya4frqg5i7c/AABpRYM--X0j3vVMnj59aWvFa?dl=0">this link</a>.  After the anonymous review process, a redirect will be placed there to point to the full (author-named) release repository.</p>
